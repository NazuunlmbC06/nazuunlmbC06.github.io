		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="helvetica" color="black" size="3">
		I am a Black kid, born in the Bronx, lived in Long Island at the age of two and later moved back to the Bronx at the age of three. As a young kid who was raised by their grandmother and grandfather being two, i grew love for animals, cars, traveling and gaming. Today being seventeen living with my mother, I've learned to take care of others, be much more reliable and responsible, and learned to manage on my own if outside. I still consistently games such as fortnite, dying light, and sometimes roblox. I came up on games such as uncharted, call of duty and more when i was younger. All of these amazing games i played made me want to become a game designer and fall in love with gaming consoles and gaming computers. Recently i've been trying to study and look out for certain jobs or maybe small internships to help me progress before my future of creating either games or creating the next best PC. Lately i've also been making tons of music and i've been getting tons of exposure from other rappers, and more, so music would also be a goal that i'd like to succeed in.

   		<td>[Piece 1: With this piece I attempted to capture the essence of penguins. I am most proud of this piece because I believe the asymmetry speaks to the collapse of a capitalistic worldview.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 2: In this piece I tried to capture the pure opposite of penguin-ness. The design was especially challenging here because representing objects along a four-dimensional plane proved to require more string theory than I had originally hoped.]</td>
   		<td>[Piece 3: This piece was inspired by the Oregon Trail during a zombie apocalypse. In the multiplicity of materials used, I tried to symbolize the lingering interposition of the Freudian superego along Jungian archetypes throughout Viennese architecture.]</td>
